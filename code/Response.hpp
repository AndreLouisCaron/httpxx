         * @brief Parser for HTTP responses.
         *
         * @c Response objects are typically used on the "client" side of the
         * HTTP connection.  After you've sent an HTTP request to the server,
         * feed incoming data to an object of this class.
         *
         * @note This class is a response @e parser.  It cannot be used to
         *  format outgoing responses.
         *
         * For high performance applications, you'll probably need to watch out
         * for memory usage.  Response objects may be used to parse additional
         * HTTP responses by using the @c clear() method.  This ensures that
         * allocate buffers are re-used instead of dumped.  Reusing response
         * objects will likely leed to faster parsing and reduced memory
         * fragmentation in long running processes.
         *
         * @code
         *  http::Response response;
         *  // parse response.
         *  while (!response.complete()) {
         *    const int transferred = ::recv(socket, data, size, 0);
         *    if (transferred == 0) {
         *      break;
         *    }
         *    response.feed(data, transferred);
         *  }
         *  if (!response.complete()) {
         *    // ...
         *  }
         *  // process response.
         *  const std::string& contenttype = request.header("Content-Type");
         *  if (contenttype == "text/html") {
         *    // ...
         *  }
         *  // signal end of transfer.
         *  if (!(response.flags()&Flags::keepalive())) {
         *    ::shutdown(socket, SD_BOTH);
         *  }
         *  // prepare to process another response.
         *  response.clear();
