         * @brief Parser for HTTP requests.
         *
         * @c Request objects are typically used on the "server" side of the
         * HTTP connection.  After you've accepted a connection from a client,
         * feed incoming data to an object of this class.
         *
         * @note This class is a request @e parser.  It cannot be used to format
         *  outgoing requests.
         *
         * For high performance applications, you'll probably need to watch out
         * for memory usage.  Request objects may be used to parse additional
         * HTTP requests by using the @c clear() method.  This ensures that
         * allocate buffers are re-used instead of dumped.  Reusing request
         * objects will likely leed to faster parsing and reduced memory
         * fragmentation in long running processes.
         *
         * @code
         *  http::Request request;
         *  // parse request.
         *  while (!request.complete()) {
         *    const int transferred = ::recv(socket, data, size, 0);
         *    if (transferred == 0) {
         *      break;
         *    }
         *    request.feed(data, transferred);
         *  }
         *  if (!request.complete()) {
         *    // ...
         *  }
         *  // process request.
         *  const std::string& host = request.header("Host");
         *  if (host == "www.example.com") {
         *    // ...
         *  }
         *  // signal end of transfer.
         *  if (!(request.flags()&Flags::keepalive())) {
         *    ::shutdown(socket, SD_BOTH);
         *  }
         *  // prepare to process another request.
         *  request.clear();
